Things stored in the user_info table:
-Desc		VarType			FieldName	Other
User ID 	(AI,PK) 		"id"		
Profile Pic	(varchar(9))	"pic"		Path to profile picture from the base root of course-site/img/profiles/
Collision	(INT)			"coll"		See first Database note.
First Name	(varchar(32))	"first_name"
Last Name	(varchar(32))	"last_name"



Notes on Database:

-Images for profile pictures are stored in the server filesystem.  The location is /course-site/img/profiles/[HASH].
	[HASH] signifies an 8-bit hash of their email, with a '0' on the end.  When a new one is created, it is first checked
	to see if the new hash plus a zero exists.  If so, try with a '1', and if that's free use a 1 and incriment the
	collision marker.  Go through this until 9 if needed, though that would statistically mean a lot more traffic than
	this site is going to get.  This is sufficient.

-Login Cookie format: ( delimeter = || )
	[userId]||[passhash+nonce]
