Where I'm at now:
-The lesson.js is in need of a fix, maybe the quiz generator in gradient-descent.php as well.
-The idea is that the index of the answer is kept as an attribute in the answer so that it can
  be pulled by the JS and used ot determine what error message to send the user if they got it
  wrong.  But it isn't working, and the attribute itself isn't showing up in the object.  Fix.

Later:
-Look at getting hover dropdown menus working for the NAV

Items to grab from an options database: (with location of variable)
-Length of login cookie life (in days) 	[db.php:setLoginCookie()]
-Required password length (chars) 		[signup.php, handle-new-user.php:line85::second block in Passwords section]
(create a method that grabs the value of a given field (pass in string) (all options in one entry?)



Notes:::

-Make a header that goes above the nav, then
  center the nav and make it more minimal and flowy.
  
-Change the main color to blue. It's more fitting for an informational site
